## Introduction

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are part of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports the UK data for the SDG indicators on the [UK SDG data website](https://sdgdata.gov.uk/).


Included in the 17 SDGs is Goal 15, which aims to ‘Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss’. One of the goal 15 indicators that, until recently, remained unreported for the UK, is **15.1.1: ‘Forest area as a proportion of total land area’**. 

### Definitions	


Forest/woodland - all forest and woodland area over 0.5 hectare with a minimum of 20% canopy cover (25% in Northern Ireland) (or the potential to achieve it) and a minimum width of 20 metres, including areas of new planting, clearfell, windblow and restocked areas. This differs from the UN definition for which the minimum canopy cover is 10% (or the potential to achieve it)

### Calculations	


**Woodland as a percentage of land area = (Area of woodland /Land area ) * 100**

Certified woodland as a percentage of land area = (Area of certified woodland / Land area) * 100
