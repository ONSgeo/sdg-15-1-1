## Introduction

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are part of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports the UK data for the SDG indicators on the [UK SDG data website](https://sdgdata.gov.uk/).


Included in the 17 SDGs is Goal 15, which aims to ‘Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss’. One of the goal 15 indicators that, until recently, remained unreported for the UK, is **15.1.1: ‘Forest area as a proportion of total land area’**. 


This indicator shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that is covered by designated protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs). Important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity are sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. Throughout this document, these are referred to as Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs).
